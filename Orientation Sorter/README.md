# Python Image Processor - orientSort
This script checks the local directory of the script location and sort the images into two directories.
## Usage

 * `<python orientSort.py>`

## Install
 * `<pip install glob>`
 * `<pip install PIL>`

## Dependency

## Bugs
- [] Reorientating images may cause the script to misread the correct orientation of the image.
